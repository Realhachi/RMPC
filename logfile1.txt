* -Extracting bounds from model
* -Perfoming root-node bound propagation
* -Calling upper solver (no solution found)
* -Branch-variables : 25

You are using LMILAB. Please don't use LMILAB with YALMIP
https://yalmip.github.io/solver/lmilab/
 
Install a better SDP solver

To get rid of this message, edit calllmilab.m  
(but don't expect support when things do not work,
YALMIP + LMILAB => No support)
